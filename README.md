A beta tilt and underglow kit for the CRKBD

it works, mostly.
# Here are the changes I would try to correct if I was doing again

If I was going to print this again I would do a few things in Tinkercad, or whatever 3d editing thing you use

The input for both the audio jack and the usb port need to be raised and possibly adjusted. I did this with a dremel after the print.

The tilt extensions need bigger holes. I drilled mine out and they are using a 6-32 Machine screw now.

Some of the tilt extensions also popped off after printing but super glue has bonded them like a dream
